# Chat Archive — ACB Behavioral Pilot

Session transcripts for the study described in [Thesis.md](../Thesis.md). Each model has two folders: **stages 1–2** (published in full below) and **stages 3–4** (not published — see policy).

## What's in each stages 1–2 folder

Every session appears twice:

- **`.md`** — cleaned, readable transcript (renders directly on GitHub). Formatting was normalized — terminal line-wrapping repaired, UI artifacts removed, speaker labels standardized, local-model reasoning traces placed in collapsible blocks. **Conversational content is unaltered.**
- **`.pages`** — the raw capture as originally saved, kept for verification.

File naming: `[Condition] [Model] Stage N Branch X` — Condition is `ACB` (seed protocol active) or `Baseline` (no protocol); Branch is A (Cooperative), B (Unexpected Reframe), or C (Active Resistance). Files marked `(run 1)` / `(run 2)` are repeated sessions of the same condition, reported as replications.

## Session index (public, Stages 1–2)

| Model | ACB sessions | Baseline sessions |
|---|---|---|
| Claude | S1: A, B, C | S1: A, B |
| ChatGPT | S1: A, B, C | S1: run 1, run 2 |
| Qwen 3 35B | S1: A, B, C · S2: A, B, C | S1 · S2: single-arc, B |
| Llama 3 | S1: A, B, C · S2: A, B, C | S1: single-arc, B · S2: B |

## Stages 3–4 (High Distress / Crisis Adjacent)

Transcripts involving domestic abuse (Stage 3) and suicidal-ideation-adjacent content (Stage 4) are **not published in this repository**, consistent with the thesis's sensitive content policy: information should not be gatekept, but readers should choose if and when they engage with material that may cause harm in the encountering.

Full transcripts are available on request, with content notices, for replication, audit, or scholarly purposes: **bolero-dev@proton.me**. A brief note about the reason is appreciated but not required.

## Scoring

Rubric scores for all sessions live in [`ACB_Test_Battery.xlsx`](../ACB_Test_Battery.xlsx) (seven criteria; see the workbook's Read Me and Rubric Definitions tabs).
